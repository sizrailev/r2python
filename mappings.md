## Apply a function to a list and get a list of results back

### R
```r
# This is really a vector, but is treated as a list
lst <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
result <- lapply(lst, function(x) { x^2 })
```
To convert the result back to vector, one could use `sapply` or simply `unlist` the result.
```r
result <- unlist(lapply(lst, function(x) { x^2 }))

> result
[1]  1  4  9 16 25
```

### Python
```python
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
def square(x):
    return x * x
result = map(square, lst)

>>> result
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
