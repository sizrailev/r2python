Making transitioning from R to Python easier. 

## Apply a function to a list and get a list of results back

### R
```r
# This is really a vector, but is treated as a list
vec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
result <- lapply(vec, function(x) { x^2 })
```
To convert the result back to vector, one could use `sapply` or simply `unlist` the result.
```r
result <- unlist(lapply(vec, function(x) { x^2 }))

> result
[1]  1  4  9 16 25
```
Note that this is a made-up example just to illustrate `lapply`. This specific calculation is R is simply
```r
> vec^2
[1]  1  4  9 16 25
```

### Python
```python
vec = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Using map with a defined function
def square(x):
    return x * x
result = map(square, vec)

# Using list comprehension (preferred)
result = [x * x for x in vec]

# Using map with a lambda function (PyLint will complain)
result = map(lambda x: x * x, vec)

>>> result
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

## Read a csv file

### R
```r
df <- read.csv("myfile.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, sep = ",")
```

### Python
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('myfile.csv', sep=',')
```

## Get dataframe's column names.

### R
```r
names(df)
```

### Python
```python
list(df)
```

## Work with a dataframe's column

### R
In R, a column `mycol` in a dataframe `df` can be addressed as `df$mycol` or `df[["mycol"]]`. The latter takes advantage of the fact that an R dataframe is a `list` of named columns of different type. A `list` also behaves as a dictionary, when elements are named, as it is in the case of a dataframe. The double square brackets address the list element using the key `"mycol"`. 

### Python
\[Is there a better way?\]
```python
col = df['mycol'].tolist()
```

## Print the first few rows of a dataframe

In R, use `head(df)`. In Python, use `df.head()`.

## Add a column to a dataframe

### R
```r
df$newcol <- vec
```

### Python
To add a simple list as a column, the following will work:
```python
df['newcol'] = vec
# or
df = df.assign(newcol=vec)
```
However, when assigning `Series`, which has an index, a simple assignment won't always work because indices of the `Series` and the `DataFrame` may not match, which results in `NaN`s. Then, the `assign` function does the job.
```python
df = df.assign(newcol=pd.Series(vec).values)
```

## Concatenate two dataframes 
We want to merge two data frames with the same number and type of columns:
```
df1[nrows1, ncols] + df2[nrows2, ncols] -> df3[nrows1 + nrows2, ncols]
```
### R
```r
df <- rbind(df1, df2)
```

### Python
In python, create a list of dataframes and use `panda`'s `concat` function.
```python
import pandas as pd
pd.concat([df1, df2])
```
